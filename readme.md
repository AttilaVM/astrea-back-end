# Astrea Scientific Volume Renderer (Back-End)

This back-end is in an very early stage of development, thankfully the [front-end](https://github.com/AttilaVM/astrea-front-end) exposes all of its functionality without this, except sample saving.

If you really intend to use Astrea with this back-end, then clone this repo, install node `v.8` or higher, fill `config.json-example`, then rename it `config.json`, and start the app with the `app/astrea` script.

However you should not use this back-end on a unsecure network, unless you like to live dangerously, then be my guest.
